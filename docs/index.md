# SDLC Documentation Library
This is a sample of what an SDLC documentation library could look like. The purpose of this library is to provide a single
source of information for enhancements undertaken by CCS that is easy to update and maintain.  Existing sytems like Trac are good for issues, but perhaps not so good at creating permanent documentation.
@TODO more information about this documentation system and library. 

## General Overview of SDLC
These documents refer to the SDLC *enhancement path* as executed by Content and Collaboration
Solutions.  These documents include all of those required for a given enhancement and also include
the templates from which they were derived. [Methodology](methodology.md) contains some definitions for SDLC terms in general and the methodology for creating this documentation.

### The SDLC Enhancement Path
@TODO add general notes about enhancement path; ie flow etc.

#### List of SDLC Dependencies (templates)
 * BNS
 * Enhancement Request
 * @TODO etc...

### SDLC Roles and Responsibilities
@TODO: *translcude* some roles and responsibilties docs. These can/should be there own documents.

### Supplemental Procedures and Implentation Strategies
@TODO flesh out the non-SDLC (or non-exclusive SDLC) procedures and strategies that CCS uses, i.e. HEAT, Trac, CentreStage etc.
