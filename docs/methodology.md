# Methodology Overview

## SDLC Methodology
The SDLC methodology we are using is adapted for McGill from Macroscope.
We have several development paths for different types of development.
The main path these documents address is that for an *enhancement* task.

### SDLC Terminology
 * @todo a list of *translcuded*? definitions.

## Documentation Methodology
A note on the methodology behind creating these documents.  Markdown, is a common, easily written and read meta-language that can compile to a subset of HTML.
It is easier for a human to easily write than HTML, but can be compiled into quite complex, and lengthy documents.
